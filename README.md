# **Automated Excel Processing with Flask**  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This is my **first personal project**, built to simplify my **father’s office workflow**. He used to spend **a lot of time manually processing Excel files**, sorting data by date, grouping specific entries, summing their values, and appending totals.  

To solve this, I **developed a Python script**, created a **Flask web application**, and deployed it on **Render**. Now, my father can simply **upload a CSV file online** and process it within **seconds** instead of hours!  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Supports CSV & Excel (XLSX) files**  
✅ **Automatically sorts and groups data**  
✅ **Calculates totals and inserts them into the file**  
✅ **User-friendly web interface with Flask**  
✅ **Deployed on Pyhtonanywhere for easy access**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Data Processing)  
- **Flask** (Web Framework)  
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)  
- **OpenPyXL** (Excel Handling)  
- **Pyhtonanywhere** (Cloud Deployment)  

## 📂 How It Works  
1. **Upload a CSV** via the web interface.  
2. **The system processes the file**, sorts and groups data, and calculates totals.  
3. **Download the processed file** instantly.
